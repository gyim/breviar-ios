<span class="bluebold">Are prayers stored in smartphone?</span>
<dd>Web pages breviar.sk (ebreviar.cz, breviar.sk/hu) and application <u>Breviary</u> for Android are designed to dynamically generate (create) texts of prayers for specified input (date).
So these prayers are NOT stored on device „anywhere“.

<span class="bluebold">Does application <u>Breviary</u> contain everything which is included on web pages breviar.sk?</span>
<dd>Application <u>Breviary</u> contains main portion of web pages breviar.sk, i. e. Slovak, Czech, and Hungarian Liturgy of Hours. Application does not contain many static pages from the web. Simply said, application <u>Breviary</u> contains everything you need for praying in these languages :)

<span class="bluebold">Why does application <u>Breviary</u> have no EXIT button?</span>
<dd>Application <u>Breviary</u> is a standard application for devices with OS Android. The android-way is that the OS stops processes when they are not needed; a running process is only some sort of "cache" for the application. For example, a browser uses back button for navigating back as well. 
Thus, we prefer not to have an explicit EXIT button. The user can just navigate somewhere else; the process is cached, until the system does not needs its resources. 
Afterwards, application state is stored, application processes are killed, and when user navigates back to the <u>Breviary</u>, the state is restored.
<br />Notification service should not eat any battery. It schedules an alarm for given time only, i.e., it asks operating system to send an event at the time of the alarm. No cpu is consumed in the application until this happens. If you do not use notifications, no alarm is scheduled, of course.
